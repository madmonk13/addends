Addends (working title)

A math puzzle game where your job is to put a grid of scrambled numbers back in order.  Based on a misunderstanding I had many, many years ago when I first saw someone playing sudoku and didn't know what it was.  (Possible name: "Not-Sudoku"?)

Todo:
1. Fix CSS issues for desktop/larger displays.
2. Level selection?
3. Custom grid generation?
